DeviceBuilder
=============

DeviceBuilder is a small Qt application that allows you to create a device tree from scratch.
You can add node with or without parameter.
You can rename the nodes.
You can set parameter's values.

This has been made for client debugging purpose.

TODO
====
 - Allow to store / recall configuration : if we use preset for that, we can then mimic any other oscquery device by just loading a preset.
 - Add other parameter types and associated widgets
 - Add attributes control
 - Add protocol control (add / remove protocols and choose their options)
